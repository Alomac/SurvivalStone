Awesome! Building a “base layer” library that covers a broad range of foundational utilities and types is a great project and super fun to shape your toolkit exactly how you want it.

Here are some ideas you could add, categorized by general functionality, to build a **“do everything-ish”** base library that supports your projects in C, D, Java, or any language you port it to:

---

## 1. **Core Types & Data Structures**

* **Custom String Type**
  Immutable & mutable variants, UTF-8/UTF-16 aware, efficient slicing, concatenation, and interop with native strings.

* **Dynamic Arrays / Lists**
  Resizable arrays with custom allocators and capacity control.

* **Fixed-size Arrays**
  Wrappers to add bounds checking and safer APIs.

* **Linked Lists / Double Linked Lists**
  Useful for certain algorithms and cache-friendly traversal.

* **Hash Maps / Dictionaries**
  Custom hash map implementations (open addressing or chaining) with customizable hash functions.

* **Set / Bitsets**
  For efficient boolean flags or membership testing.

* **Optional / Maybe Type**
  Safe wrapper to represent “value or nothing” instead of using null pointers.

---

## 2. **Memory & Resource Management**

* **Allocator Abstraction**
  Interfaces for different allocation strategies (pool, stack, arena, GC, manual).

* **Memory Pools / Arenas**
  Fast allocation and deallocation for game objects or temporary data.

* **Reference Counting & Smart Pointers**
  To manage ownership in a safer way.

* **Scope Guards / Deferred Execution**
  For RAII-style cleanup or ensuring functions run on scope exit.

---

## 3. **Concurrency & Synchronization**

* **Mutexes, Spinlocks, RWLocks**
  Lightweight primitives for safe multi-threaded access.

* **Thread Pools**
  Abstract thread management for async tasks.

* **Atomic Types & Operations**
  Lock-free programming building blocks.

* **Futures / Promises**
  For managing asynchronous results.

---

## 4. **Mathematics & Utilities**

* **Vector & Matrix Types**
  For 2D/3D graphics, physics, or general math.

* **Quaternion Implementation**
  For 3D rotations.

* **Random Number Generators**
  Custom PRNGs with seeds.

* **Interpolation Functions**
  Linear, cubic, smoothstep, easing curves.

* **Bit Manipulation Utilities**
  Bit counting, masking, rotating, endian swaps.

* **Hashing Utilities**
  Custom or standard hashing (e.g., FNV-1a, MurmurHash).

---

## 5. **Strings & Text Processing**

* **Unicode Helpers**
  Code point iteration, normalization, encoding conversions.

* **String Formatting**
  Custom printf-style or safer formatters.

* **Parsing Helpers**
  Tokenizers, lexers, small parser combinators.

---

## 6. **File & I/O Abstractions**

* **Cross-platform File APIs**
  Abstract open/read/write/close with error handling.

* **Memory-mapped Files**
  For efficient file access.

* **Buffered I/O**
  To improve performance.

---

## 7. **Error Handling**

* **Error Types / Result Wrappers**
  Tagged unions or sum types to represent errors and results.

* **Assertions & Debug Helpers**
  Macros or functions that help catch bugs early.

---

## 8. **Time & Scheduling**

* **Timers & Stopwatch**
  For benchmarking or frame timing.

* **Sleep & Yield Functions**
  Cross-platform thread control.

---

## 9. **Platform & System**

* **CPU Feature Detection**
  Detect SIMD, instruction sets, cache sizes.

* **Cross-platform abstractions**
  Threads, sockets, environment variables.

---

## 10. **Meta & Reflection (for D & Java)**

* **Compile-time Reflection Utilities**
  To query types and generate code.

* **Serialization / Deserialization**
  For saving/loading objects.

* **Type Traits & Concepts**
  For generic programming helpers.

---

## Bonus: Fun little utilities

* **Logging Framework**
  Customizable log levels and outputs.

* **Command Line Parsing**
  Argument parsing helpers.

* **Unit Testing Framework**
  Basic test runner with assertions.

---

### How to Start?

You could build incrementally — pick a few of these that excite you the most. For example, start with:

* Your custom String type
* Dynamic arrays & optionals
* Memory pool allocator

Then layer on math utilities or concurrency primitives later.

If you want, I can help draft some initial code snippets for any of these ideas in D (or C/Java). Which ones catch your eye?
